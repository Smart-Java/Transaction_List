## Flutter SDK
3. Make sure you have Flutter SDK installed on your system. If not, download it from the official Flutter website: [https://flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
4. Extract the downloaded Flutter SDK package and add the `flutter/bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable.
5. Verify the Flutter installation by running the following command in your terminal:
